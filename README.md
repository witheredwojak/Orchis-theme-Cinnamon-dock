# Orchis-theme-Cinnamon-dock
Makes Cinnamon's bottom pannel looks like a dock. Based on dark version of [Orchis GTK theme] (https://github.com/vinceliuice/Orchis-theme#orchis-theme).

## Installation

Install as usual `(copy Orchis-dark-dock to /home/user/.themes/)` and select this theme as your Desktop theme for Cinnamon. Add a panel at the bottom (if you don't have one) and then add a `Grouped window list` applet to the center of the panel.
